- #### losg = LOSguidance(Kp, Ra, pass_angle_threshold):
  This constructor can be used to create an instance of the **LOSguidance** class.
- #### [chi_d, U_d] = compute_LOSRef(wp_pos, wp_speed, x, wp_idx):
  This method is used to calculate reference course angles and speed commands.
- #### wp_idx = find_active_wp_segment(wp_pos, x, wp_idx):
  This method is used to find the active waypoint segment depending on the current position of the vessel.
